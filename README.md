# UI development for space architecture
Access here: https://claireluchen.github.io <br>
This research explores behavioral risks associated with extreme environments, particularly in spaceflights, with the goal of enhancing space architecture designs. We also seek to visually depict the intricate connection between human emotions, psychology, and their surroundings. This interactive website serves as a user-friendly interface to help the public visualize spaceflight challenges and their intricate relationships. It explores behavioral risks with respect to different factors, such as lighting and crew selection. <br>
The homepage is an overview of factors associated with spaceflight: mission parameters, mediator variables, processes, outcomes, and mission success. <br>
Each subsequent layer provides insights into increasingly specific factors. User can hover over each box to learn more about each factor and how their connections to others. <br>
